## Study Introduction

### Chatbot Interaction

In the following, you will see an applicant at a time, and you will need to give an initial prediction for how you think
the ML model would decide for this applicant. After that, you will then be able to ask questions about the prediction
and the model behaviour to understand the model better. To end the interaction with the applicant, you will need to
give a final prediction for how you think the model would decide for this applicant.

### Step 1: Understanding the Model

In the first phase you will be shown 10 applicants with their attributes and the model's prediction.
For each applicant, you will have the possibility to ask predefined questions about the prediction that will be
answered by techniques from explainable AI. Feel free to provide your own questions if you can't find
it in the provided collection.

### Phase 2: Reflection about Model Behaviour

In the second phase you will be asked to reflect on the model behavior and answer some questions about it.

### Phase 3: Final Questionnaire

In the final questionnaire, we will ask you some questions about your experience with the study. We are interested
in your opinion about the questions and answers and how you understood the models' behaviour.
