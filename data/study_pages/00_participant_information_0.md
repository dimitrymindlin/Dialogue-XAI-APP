# Dear Participant, welcome to the study!

We are excited to welcome you to our study on understanding decisions of machine learning models. 
This research aims to gain a better understanding of the questions and answers that lead to a good understanding of the behaviour of a machine learning model.
We appreciate your willingness to take part in our research.


Before we begin, we would like to gather some information about you that will help us better understand the results of our study.
