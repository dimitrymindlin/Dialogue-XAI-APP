## The study consists of 3 Phases

### Phase 1: Understanding the Model

In the first phase you will be shown {number} applicants with their attributes and the model's prediction.
For each applicant, you will have the possibility to ask predefined questions about the prediction that will be
answered by techniques from explainable AI. Feel free to provide your own questions if you can't find
it in the provided collection.

### Phase 2: Classifying Applicants

In the second phase you will see new applicants, and you will be asked to guess how the model would decide 
for them.

### Phase 3: Final Questionaire

In the final questionaire, we will ask you some questions about your experience with the study. We are interested
in your opinion about the questions and answers and how you understood the models' behaviour.
