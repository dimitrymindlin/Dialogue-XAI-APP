## This study aims to assess what helps humans to understand machine learning models and their predictions with the help of explainable AI

The ML model used in this study is like a smart computer program that has been trained using a bunch of loan application
data. Its job is to predict if someone applying for a loan is likely to be a high risk customer or a low risk customer.

To train the model, we gathered a bunch of information about loan applicants, like their age, gender, job level, and 
more. We also labeled each applicant as either high risk or low risk based on their history. The model then analyzed all
of this information and tried to find patterns and connections between the different characteristics and the risk levels.

It learned which combinations of information were more likely to indicate a high risk or low risk applicant. 
This "learning" happened by looking at many examples and adjusting its settings to make better predictions based on the
patterns it discovered.

Once the model was trained, it could use what it learned to make predictions about new loan applications that it hadn't
seen before. It could tell us the chances of someone being a high risk customer based on the patterns it learned from 
the training data.
