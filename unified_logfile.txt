User model after unified MAPE-K: The user's cognitive state is active, characterized by straightforward participation through repetition or acknowledgment without contributing additional ideas; this is the lowest form of engagement compared to both the idea-generating constructive state and the dynamic, collaborative interactive state..
The user's ML knowledge is Low, which means that the user may have a basic understanding of AI from casual exposure or news reports. Explanations should focus on simple ideas and relatable examples, avoiding technical jargon or complex interpretability methods..
 The user's understanding about the explanations is detailed here with the keys what the user UNDERSTOOD, NOT_UNDERSTOOD, or NOT_YET_EXPLAINED
