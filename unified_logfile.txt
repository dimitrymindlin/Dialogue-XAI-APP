User model after unified MAPE-K: The user's cognitive state is interactive, characterized by a dynamic, two-way collaboration where both parties build and refine ideas together; this is the highest level of engagement, contrasting with the independent idea generation of the constructive state and the minimal participation of the active state..
The user's ML knowledge is Low, which means that the user may have a basic understanding of AI from casual exposure or news reports. Explanations should focus on simple ideas and relatable examples, avoiding technical jargon or complex interpretability methods..
With the last message they signalled ['signal_partial_understanding'].
 The user's understanding about the explanations is detailed here with the keys what the user UNDERSTOOD, NOT_UNDERSTOOD, or NOT_YET_EXPLAINED
