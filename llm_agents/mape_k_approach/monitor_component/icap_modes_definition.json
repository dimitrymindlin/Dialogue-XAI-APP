  {
    "name": "interactive",
    "description": "Engagement where the user and the agent collaboratively refine understanding through a back-and-forth dialogue. This mode is the most cognitively engaging as it requires the user to not only critique or clarify but also integrate responses into a shared understanding, often leading to co-construction of knowledge.",
    "example": "Example: The user asks, 'How can marital status be relevant here? Isn't that a biased assumption?' and follows up with, 'If marital status is removed, does the importance of age increase? Can you explain how that happens?'"
  },
  {
    "name": "constructive",
    "description": "Engagement where the user actively generates new ideas, explanations, or hypotheses based on the agent's response. While this mode is more cognitively engaging than the active mode as it involves deeper thinking and creating new knowledge, it is less cognitively demanding than interactive engagement, as it focuses on individual knowledge generation rather than collaborative refinement.",
    "example": "Example: The user says, 'If income is a key feature, does that mean reducing it by 10% would significantly lower the prediction probability?' or 'So, would removing marital status make income the dominant feature?'"
  },
  {
    "name": "active",
    "description": "Engagement where the user participates in the conversation but does not add new ideas. This mode is the least cognitevely engaging.",
    "example": "Example: The user repeats what the agent said, does not provide any new information."
